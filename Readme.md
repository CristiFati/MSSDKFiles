The purpose of this repository is hosting some (very few) files from the package in order to avoid installing it.
- The most important (and currently, the only) ones are *Win32.mak* (and *NtWin.mak*), required by (some) *NMake* builds
    - Check [[SO]: Visual Studio NMake build fails with: fatal error U1052: file 'win32.mak' not found](https://stackoverflow.com/q/73159159/4788546) for more details
